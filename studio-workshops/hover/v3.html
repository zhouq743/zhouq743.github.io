    <h1>Leaked 2021 Apple iMac redesign is stunning</h1>
    <div>
    <p>If there's one Apple product that's due a fresh coat of paint, it's the iMac. Last redesigned centuries ago (in 2012), the all-in-one desktop machine is currently sporting one of Apple's oldest product designs. But a wild new leak has revealed that the iMac could be in for a very colourful upgrade in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only will the 2021 iMac allegedly feature a brand new design, but it will also supposedly come in five brand new hues. And judging by new 3D renders of the line up (below), our best computer for graphic design is about to look a lot more vibrant.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to everyone's favourite Apple leaker, Jon Prosser, the 2021 iMac will come in black, white, green, blue, and rose gold. Recent rumours have suggested that the new iMac will feature slimmer bezels and a thinner overall body (similar to Apple's Apple 32" XDR Display), and Prosser's renders depict a straighter and narrower profile.

        So, those colours. The most obvious thing to note about the pastel hues is that they're lifted straight from the 2020 iPad Air. The move suggests Apple is moving to consolidate its product colour schemes (although if this is the case, it's odd that company didn't choose to release the the iPhone 12 in the same muted tones).
