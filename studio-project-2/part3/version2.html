    <div id='text'><p id='main'>In t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e rus<span class=‘h’>h</span>-<span class=‘h’>h</span>our train one evening last summer, I looked around at all t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e women in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e carriage. Middle-aged women <span class=‘h’>h</span>urtling towards t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e suburbs. Pregnant women <span class=‘h’>h</span>olding t<span class=‘h’>h</span>eir lower backs. Teenage girls slick wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> sebum. Elderly women standing stoically by t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e doors. I realised every one of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>em will <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave some story about <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow t<span class=‘h’>h</span>eir reproductive systems <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave affected t<span class=‘h’>h</span>eir lives. And I t<span class=‘h’>h</span>oug<span class=‘h’>h</span>t: <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow muc<span class=‘h’>h</span> <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave you kept secret?

        Because one day in our early lives as women, everyt<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anges. We start bleeding. And in an instant we’re no longer a c<span class=‘h’>h</span>ild. I was on a crazy golf course overlooking cromer pier w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en I experienced period pain for t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e first time. My lower body rippled wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> a new sensation. It was a pain t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at didn’t fit inside my body, burning t<span class=‘h’>h</span>roug<span class=‘h’>h</span> my t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ig<span class=‘h’>h</span>s. I explained to Dad t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at I didn’t feel well. I was aware of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ift in <span class=‘h’>h</span>is gaze towards me in a way t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at I absolutely did not <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e language for. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>at Britis<span class=‘h’>h</span> coastal perfume, t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ick wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> sun-roasted kelp and old deep-fat-fryer oil, took t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e nausea t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at came wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ese s<span class=‘h’>h</span>arp c<span class=‘h’>h</span>urns to anot<span class=‘h’>h</span>er level. I <span class=‘h’>h</span>ad to sit down on t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e grass. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>e pain spoke to me. It told me my <span class=‘h’>h</span>uman fabric <span class=‘h’>h</span>ad c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anged. As evidence of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e encoding t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at <span class=‘h’>h</span>appened, now w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en I <span class=‘h’>h</span>ear seagulls, I still <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave flas<span class=‘h’>h</span> visions of lying down <span class=‘h’>h</span>olding my belly.
        
        I’m in my mid-30s now and my periods <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave always been a p<span class=‘h’>h</span>ysical and mental slog. It is t<span class=‘h’>h</span>oug<span class=‘h’>h</span>t t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at 90% of women experience some premenstrual c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anges, even if mildly. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>ere are more t<span class=‘h’>h</span>an 150 clinically identified symptoms of PMS, including irritability, anxiety, depression and <span class=‘h’>h</span>eadac<span class=‘h’>h</span>es. A laug<span class=‘h’>h</span> riot, in ot<span class=‘h’>h</span>er words.
        
        I <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave spent years trying to gain autonomy over t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e way my <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones seem to make my mind and body be<span class=‘h’>h</span>ave. Around five years ago, prompted by a breakdown-of-sorts, I soug<span class=‘h’>h</span>t <span class=‘h’>h</span>elp for t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e anxiety I <span class=‘h’>h</span>ad done my very best to conceal from everyone, including myself, for well over a decade. After talking to my GP, I tried all sorts of interventions in my quest for emotional stability. I was referred to (almost exclusively male) gynaecologists w<span class=‘h’>h</span>ose conversations and <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal prescriptions made me feel eit<span class=‘h’>h</span>er a) madder or b) ever so slig<span class=‘h’>h</span>tly less mad for a s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ort amount of time. I tried acupuncture, vitamin supplements and diet c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anges. I realised t<span class=‘h’>h</span>is precise, reliable emotional state I soug<span class=‘h’>h</span>t was elusive at best.
        
        Instead, I was surprised by a growing sense of peace. Addressing t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e patterns of my mood wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> a t<span class=‘h’>h</span>erapist, we looked closely at t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ame I attac<span class=‘h’>h</span>ed to being sensitive, sad or scared in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e second <span class=‘h’>h</span>alf of my cycle and asked w<span class=‘h’>h</span>ere it came from. After researc<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing anxiety, I started training to become a psyc<span class=‘h’>h</span>ologist and began researc<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones. I started to see t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ings in a way I never t<span class=‘h’>h</span>oug<span class=‘h’>h</span>t I would. I <span class=‘h’>h</span>ad a new question, and t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at was: w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at am I seeking relief from?
        
        I’ve come to believe t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at greater awareness of our <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal processes can <span class=‘h’>h</span>elp us not only to manage our corresponding moods, but also to conceptualise w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at a mood actually is: a state of being t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at is, by its nature, temporary, and rarely directly attributable to one t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing. It’s an interesting dic<span class=‘h’>h</span>otomy, t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at we can be quite disconnected from w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at’s actually going on w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en our <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones are fluctuating – w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en oestrogen dramatically rises, for example, during ovulation – and yet be so ready to self-police w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en we feel anyt<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing ot<span class=‘h’>h</span>er t<span class=‘h’>h</span>an sanguine and pain-free.
        
        We blame so muc<span class=‘h’>h</span> on being “<span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal”: irrationality, “bad” decision-making, angry outbursts, low self-esteem. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>at wasn’t t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e real me, we mig<span class=‘h’>h</span>t t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ink, agonising over a knee-jerk decision we made at work, or taking offence at a t<span class=‘h’>h</span>rowaway comment in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e pub. It was my <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>e same p<span class=‘h’>h</span>rase could cover everyt<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing from wanting to kill your partner at t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e dinner table to <span class=‘h’>h</span>aving frantic sex wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> t<span class=‘h’>h</span>em on it.
        
        In some ways, “<span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal” is t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e modern-day “<span class=‘h’>h</span>ysterical” – a word most women will <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave t<span class=‘h’>h</span>eir own associations wit<span class=‘h’>h</span>. Mine are profuse. Years and years of secretly believing t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at I am just on t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e cusp of losing control: of my emotions, my appetite, my sexuality. Sometimes, I t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ink I’m a <span class=‘h’>h</span>air-trigger away from exploding. Because I’ve quietly believed I’m… well, too muc<span class=‘h’>h</span>. Almost every woman I <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave known well <span class=‘h’>h</span>as spoken of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>is belief; one t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ey mostly keep tucked up, because admitting t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e fear means facing t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e idea t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at maybe we don’t <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave in<span class=‘h’>h</span>erent autonomy; t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at our woman-ness will always “get” us in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e end. W<span class=‘h’>h</span>at if t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ere was a different way of looking at t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ings? W<span class=‘h’>h</span>at if we could work towards dismantling t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e self-blame and, t<span class=‘h’>h</span>erefore, stop ot<span class=‘h’>h</span>ering t<span class=‘h’>h</span>is fundamental part of w<span class=‘h’>h</span>o we are?
        Acknowledging t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e stigma surrounding female reproductive processes is still alive and well is t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e first rung, I t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ink, on t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e ladder towards self-acceptance. Most women know t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e crack of relief w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en someone dares to start talking about periods, t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e reality of birt<span class=‘h’>h</span>, miscarriage or menopause, and ot<span class=‘h’>h</span>er women say, o<span class=‘h’>h</span> t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ank God. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>is stigma is like an iceberg. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>e tip above t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e surface is women’s day-to-day suffering wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> w<span class=‘h’>h</span>atever process t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ey’re going t<span class=‘h’>h</span>roug<span class=‘h’>h</span>; a suffering t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ey feel unable to fully express, per<span class=‘h’>h</span>aps t<span class=‘h’>h</span>roug<span class=‘h’>h</span> fear of embarrassment, of disgusting ot<span class=‘h’>h</span>ers or t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ey’ll be dismissed. Underneat<span class=‘h’>h</span> t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e surface is t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e way women’s <span class=‘h’>h</span>ealt<span class=‘h’>h</span> and pain <span class=‘h’>h</span>as been, still is, viewed and treated in society.
        
        It is sweet fantasy to say t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at all t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e myt<span class=‘h’>h</span>s, misinformation and ickiness surrounding female reproductive processes <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave been – finally – banis<span class=‘h’>h</span>ed into t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e fusty past. It’s silly, really, because t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e word “<span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal” applies as muc<span class=‘h’>h</span> to a testosterone-c<span class=‘h’>h</span>arged city banker as it does to a woman about to <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave <span class=‘h’>h</span>er period. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>e metabolic processes of all organisms can only take place in very specific c<span class=‘h’>h</span>emical environments and, in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e <span class=‘h’>h</span>uman body, <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones are special c<span class=‘h’>h</span>emical messengers t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at, as part of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e endocrine system, <span class=‘h’>h</span>elp to control most major bodily functions. Male, female, or anyw<span class=‘h’>h</span>ere on t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e spectrum of gender, <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones keep us alive. Yet “<span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal” is still a tool for explaining away a woman’s experience of <span class=‘h’>h</span>er c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anging bioc<span class=‘h’>h</span>emistry. And so we try and keep sc<span class=‘h’>h</span>tum, lest we be slapped wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> suc<span class=‘h’>h</span> a <span class=‘h’>h</span>istorically damaging label: <span class=‘h’>h</span>ysterical.
        
        W<span class=‘h’>h</span>en I effectively ran out of PMS treatment options, it made me realise <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow entrenc<span class=‘h’>h</span>ed my analysis of my own t<span class=‘h’>h</span>oug<span class=‘h’>h</span>ts and be<span class=‘h’>h</span>aviour was in more general ideas of <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow I “s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ould” or “s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ouldn’t” be as a woman. In t<span class=‘h’>h</span>erapy and in my psyc<span class=‘h’>h</span>ological study, I realised <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e workings of my inner world are often in collision wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e outer world and all t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e expectations I perceive it to <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave of me. A better understanding of w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at goes on inside us, of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e connection between our bodies and minds, is an important part of reclaiming meaning. We are not post-biology. We are protecting no one by pretending t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at we don’t bleed. We are not protecting ourselves by ignoring t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e external factors t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at may affect our bodily experiences, including t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e way modern medicine still doesn’t take t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e variance of women’s pain – or t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e voice describing t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at pain – seriously.
        
        Women can wait between four and 10 years after first seeing a doctor wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> symptoms of endometriosis and a diagnosis. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>e average is seven-and-a-<span class=‘h’>h</span>alf years. In 2017, t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e National Institute for <SPAN CLASS=‘H’>H</SPAN>ealt<span class=‘h’>h</span> and care Excellence released guidelines urging GPs not to overlook symptoms of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e disorder, because for it to be repeatedly inferred t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at you are overreacting to your pain, your experience of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at pain is going to become stained wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> confusion, fear and guilt. It is difficult to argue t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at medicine does not <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave an in<span class=‘h’>h</span>erent bias against women. Women presenting at <span class=‘h’>h</span>ospitals wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> pain are not only given fewer painkillers t<span class=‘h’>h</span>an men, but are often offered sedatives instead. Treatment for women wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> coronary <span class=‘h’>h</span>eart disease is delayed compared to men. All t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ese facts are corroborated by robust data. W<span class=‘h’>h</span>en a woman says <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow s<span class=‘h’>h</span>e feels, w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at s<span class=‘h’>h</span>e wants or w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at s<span class=‘h’>h</span>e needs, someone always knows better.
        
        Knowing ourselves better gives us t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e power to ask for better. For example, I used to panic sometimes at t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e pain I can <span class=‘h’>h</span>ave wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> ovulation. I knew I always felt it, but didn’t know w<span class=‘h’>h</span>y. Learning t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at mittelsc<span class=‘h’>h</span>merz (t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e German words for “middle” and “pain”) is t<span class=‘h’>h</span>oug<span class=‘h’>h</span>t to be caused by one of our eggs rupturing t<span class=‘h’>h</span>roug<span class=‘h’>h</span> a sac (follicle) on an ovary, releasing fluid and a small amount of blood t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at can travel t<span class=‘h’>h</span>roug<span class=‘h’>h</span> t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e ovary wall and irritate nerves in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e lining of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e abdominal cavity, was a strange comfort. So, too, was learning from a prominent gynaecologist t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at <span class=‘h’>h</span>e <span class=‘h’>h</span>as seen women presenting in A&E in tears wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> acute pelvic pain, w<span class=‘h’>h</span>ose only clinically significant finding turns out to be recent ovulation. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>is s<span class=‘h’>h</span>it is real and it <span class=‘h’>h</span>urts. W<span class=‘h’>h</span>at’s sad is t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at my private experience alone didn’t feel like good enoug<span class=‘h’>h</span> evidence to finally ask for pain relief.
        
        On some level, a focus on a woman’s c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anging bioc<span class=‘h’>h</span>emistry t<span class=‘h’>h</span>roug<span class=‘h’>h</span>out <span class=‘h’>h</span>er cycle – or any ot<span class=‘h’>h</span>er reproductive process – mig<span class=‘h’>h</span>t be seen to remove some of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e stigma. It’s just my <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>at t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ere could be a clear, c<span class=‘h’>h</span>emical “reason” for a certain type of be<span class=‘h’>h</span>aviour or way of feeling is, on t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e surface, legitimising and reassuring. Alt<span class=‘h’>h</span>oug<span class=‘h’>h</span>, if any woman is able to ride out days of feeling low eac<span class=‘h’>h</span> mont<span class=‘h’>h</span> by being aware of <span class=‘h’>h</span>er cycle patterns; or finds t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at telling <span class=‘h’>h</span>erself t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e way s<span class=‘h’>h</span>e’s feeling is “just c<span class=‘h’>h</span>emical” is a strategy t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at stops <span class=‘h’>h</span>er going up into t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at second gear of self-analysis and existential woe, I absolutely lift my <span class=‘h’>h</span>at to <span class=‘h’>h</span>er. Personally, given w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at I now know about t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e imprecision of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e science of <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow our <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones can affect our mood, I try to resist t<span class=‘h’>h</span>inking t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at I am a c<span class=‘h’>h</span>emically controlled robot. I try to see my distress as part of a mini-ecosystem t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at includes my c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anging <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones, asking myself: w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at else is going on to upset my mind? <SPAN CLASS=‘H’>H</SPAN>ow p<span class=‘h’>h</span>ysically well am I rig<span class=‘h’>h</span>t now? W<span class=‘h’>h</span>at <span class=‘h’>h</span>elps?
        
        Researc<span class=‘h’>h</span> tells us t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at our <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal fluctuations do seem to affect <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow c<span class=‘h’>h</span>emical signals pass t<span class=‘h’>h</span>roug<span class=‘h’>h</span> our brain – as any neuroscientist would tell you, we just don’t know exactly <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow or w<span class=‘h’>h</span>y. In all fields of brain study it is accepted t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at mental distress is not caused by one t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing in isolation. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>e electrical, c<span class=‘h’>h</span>emical brain is not extricable from t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e subjective mind. W<span class=‘h’>h</span>at we talk about is multi-causality: a fancy word for t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e concept t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at lots of different factors contribute to <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow we feel mentally. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>erefore, w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en we talk about processes <span class=‘h’>h</span>appening in a woman’s body t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at place us at “increased risk” of depression or anxiety, it seems not just blindingly logical, but respectful to consider t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at body in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e wider sc<span class=‘h’>h</span>eme of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ings.
        
        Per<span class=‘h’>h</span>aps, t<span class=‘h’>h</span>en, a more realistic p<span class=‘h’>h</span>rase t<span class=‘h’>h</span>an, “It’s just my <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones,” would be, “My <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormones mig<span class=‘h’>h</span>t predispose me to feeling terrible sometimes.”
        
        Our fluctuating biology is not t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e w<span class=‘h’>h</span>ole story but a significant part of our emotional lives. T<span class=‘h’>h</span>e <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anges and symptoms of menopause are very real and can be very <span class=‘h’>h</span>ard. W<span class=‘h’>h</span>en my <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormone levels c<span class=‘h’>h</span>ange, notably at ovulation (soaring oestrogen) and in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e week before I get my period (soaring progestogen, <span class=‘h’>h</span>ig<span class=‘h’>h</span> oestrogen), it really can feel like I’ve stepped inside t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e skin of a different person – t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at I am not myself. But w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at is “myself” if not a sensitive-by-design brain and body t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at is always c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anging and responding to t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e world it in<span class=‘h’>h</span>abits and t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e people around it? From w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at fixed, ideal state do I feel I am slipping w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en I am more emotional for t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e second <span class=‘h’>h</span>alf of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e mont<span class=‘h’>h</span>?
        
        As <span class=‘h’>h</span>uman beings, r<span class=‘h’>h</span>yt<span class=‘h’>h</span>m is part of our deep core. Breat<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing, pumping, contracting: t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ese are all actions of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e body t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at keep us alive and keep our species going. Menstruation is anot<span class=‘h’>h</span>er r<span class=‘h’>h</span>yt<span class=‘h’>h</span>m unique to women. But w<span class=‘h’>h</span>ile our biology and w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at is <span class=‘h’>h</span>appening inside us is important, we cannot act as if t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e body is an anatomical drawing floating in space; t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at it is now<span class=‘h’>h</span>ere. clearly, if a woman’s premenstrual distress is suc<span class=‘h’>h</span> t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at s<span class=‘h’>h</span>e feels unable to function, s<span class=‘h’>h</span>e s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ould, in an ideal world, be receiving dedicated <span class=‘h’>h</span>ealt<span class=‘h’>h</span>care and support. Is t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ere somet<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing wider we s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ould be asking about <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow, as a society, we frame w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at women say and do w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ey are anyt<span class=‘h’>h</span>ing ot<span class=‘h’>h</span>er t<span class=‘h’>h</span>an sanguine, nurturing and polite?
        
        Are we saving up anger, our base need for affection, and our tears for t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ree weeks of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e mont<span class=‘h’>h</span>? As our <span class=‘h’>h</span>ormonal levels s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ift, could t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ey be acting as a kind of “trut<span class=‘h’>h</span> serum”, lubricating t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e passage of w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at we really want to say or do? It’s a radical idea and I quite like it. W<span class=‘h’>h</span>at if w<span class=‘h’>h</span>at we feel during t<span class=‘h’>h</span>ose times of t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e mont<span class=‘h’>h</span> w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en we are so quick to say we are being irrational is t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e most “real” we are? T<span class=‘h’>h</span>e science surrounding w<span class=‘h’>h</span>atever signalling c<span class=‘h’>h</span>anges <span class=‘h’>h</span>appen in t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e emotion-processing parts of our brain during t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e menstrual cycle is too fuzzy to definitively say ot<span class=‘h’>h</span>erwise. could it be t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at, w<span class=‘h’>h</span>en t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e mantle of self-censors<span class=‘h’>h</span>ip drops and we are less caug<span class=‘h’>h</span>t up wit<span class=‘h’>h</span> fearing <span class=‘h’>h</span>ow we’ll be seen, we’re accessing all t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at <span class=‘h’>h</span>istorical oppression and, in s<span class=‘h’>h</span>ort bursts, letting it go? All t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at so-called “excess”, t<span class=‘h’>h</span>e stuff t<span class=‘h’>h</span>at makes a woman “<span class=‘h’>h</span>ysterical” could just be… trut<span class=‘h’>h</span>.
