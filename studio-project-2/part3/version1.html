    <div id='text'><p id='main'>In the rush-hour train one evening last summer, I looked around at all the women in the <span class=‘c’>c</span>arriage. Middle-aged women hurtling towards the suburbs. Pregnant women holding their lower ba<span class=‘c’>c</span>ks. Teenage girls sli<span class=‘c’>c</span>k with sebum. Elderly women standing stoi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ally by the doors. I realised every one of them will have some story about how their reprodu<span class=‘c’>c</span>tive systems have affe<span class=‘c’>c</span>ted their lives. And I thought: how mu<span class=‘c’>c</span>h have you kept se<span class=‘c’>c</span>ret?

        Be<span class=‘c’ id='b'>c</span>ause one day in our early lives as women, everything <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanges. We start bleeding. And in an instant we’re no longer a <span class=‘c’>c</span>hild. I was on a <span class=‘c’>c</span>razy golf <span class=‘c’>c</span>ourse overlooking <span class=‘c’>c</span>romer pier when I experien<span class=‘c’>c</span>ed period pain for the first time. My lower body rippled with a new sensation. It was a pain that didn’t fit inside my body, burning through my thighs. I explained to Dad that I didn’t feel well. I was aware of the shift in his gaze towards me in a way that I absolutely did not have the language for. That British <span class=‘c’>c</span>oastal perfume, thi<span class=‘c’>c</span>k with sun-roasted kelp and old deep-fat-fryer oil, took the nausea that <span class=‘c’>c</span>ame with these sharp <span class=‘c’>c</span>hurns to another level. I had to sit down on the grass. The pain spoke to me. It told me my human fabri<span class=‘c’>c</span> had <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanged. As eviden<span class=‘c’>c</span>e of the en<span class=‘c’>c</span>oding that happened, now when I hear seagulls, I still have flash visions of lying down holding my belly.
        
        I’m in my mid-30s now and my periods have always been a physi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al and mental slog. It is thought that 90% of women experien<span class=‘c’>c</span>e some premenstrual <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanges, even if mildly. There are more than 150 <span class=‘c’>c</span>lini<span class=‘c’>c</span>ally identified symptoms of PMS, in<span class=‘c’>c</span>luding irritability, anxiety, depression and heada<span class=‘c’>c</span>hes. A laugh riot, in other words.
        
        I have spent years trying to gain autonomy over the way my hormones seem to make my mind and body behave. Around five years ago, prompted by a breakdown-of-sorts, I sought help for the anxiety I had done my very best to <span class=‘c’>c</span>on<span class=‘c’>c</span>eal from everyone, in<span class=‘c’>c</span>luding myself, for well over a de<span class=‘c’>c</span>ade. After talking to my GP, I tried all sorts of interventions in my quest for emotional stability. I was referred to (almost ex<span class=‘c’>c</span>lusively male) gynae<span class=‘c’>c</span>ologists whose <span class=‘c’>c</span>onversations and hormonal pres<span class=‘c’>c</span>riptions made me feel either a) madder or b) ever so slightly less mad for a short amount of time. I tried a<span class=‘c’>c</span>upun<span class=‘c’>c</span>ture, vitamin supplements and diet <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanges. I realised this pre<span class=‘c’>c</span>ise, reliable emotional state I sought was elusive at best.
        
        Instead, I was surprised by a growing sense of pea<span class=‘c’>c</span>e. Addressing the patterns of my mood with a therapist, we looked <span class=‘c’>c</span>losely at the shame I atta<span class=‘c’>c</span>hed to being sensitive, sad or s<span class=‘c’>c</span>ared in the se<span class=‘c’>c</span>ond half of my <span class=‘c’>c</span>y<span class=‘c’>c</span>le and asked where it <span class=‘c’>c</span>ame from. After resear<span class=‘c’>c</span>hing anxiety, I started training to be<span class=‘c’>c</span>ome a psy<span class=‘c’>c</span>hologist and began resear<span class=‘c’>c</span>hing hormones. I started to see things in a way I never thought I would. I had a new question, and that was: what am I seeking relief from?
        
        I’ve <span class=‘c’>c</span>ome to believe that greater awareness of our hormonal pro<span class=‘c’>c</span>esses <span class=‘c’>c</span>an help us not only to manage our <span class=‘c’>c</span>orresponding moods, but also to <span class=‘c’>c</span>on<span class=‘c’>c</span>eptualise what a mood a<span class=‘c’>c</span>tually is: a state of being that is, by its nature, temporary, and rarely dire<span class=‘c’>c</span>tly attributable to one thing. It’s an interesting di<span class=‘c’>c</span>hotomy, that we <span class=‘c’>c</span>an be quite dis<span class=‘c’>c</span>onne<span class=‘c’>c</span>ted from what’s a<span class=‘c’>c</span>tually going on when our hormones are flu<span class=‘c’>c</span>tuating – when oestrogen dramati<span class=‘c’>c</span>ally rises, for example, during ovulation – and yet be so ready to self-poli<span class=‘c’>c</span>e when we feel anything other than sanguine and pain-free.
        
        We blame so mu<span class=‘c’>c</span>h on being “hormonal”: irrationality, “bad” de<span class=‘c’>c</span>ision-making, angry outbursts, low self-esteem. That wasn’t the real me, we might think, agonising over a knee-jerk de<span class=‘c’>c</span>ision we made at work, or taking offen<span class=‘c’>c</span>e at a throwaway <span class=‘c’>c</span>omment in the pub. It was my hormones. The same phrase <span class=‘c’>c</span>ould <span class=‘c’>c</span>over everything from wanting to kill your partner at the dinner table to having franti<span class=‘c’>c</span> sex with them on it.
        
        In some ways, “hormonal” is the modern-day “hysteri<span class=‘c’>c</span>al” – a word most women will have their own asso<span class=‘c’>c</span>iations with. Mine are profuse. Years and years of se<span class=‘c’>c</span>retly believing that I am just on the <span class=‘c’>c</span>usp of losing <span class=‘c’>c</span>ontrol: of my emotions, my appetite, my sexuality. Sometimes, I think I’m a hair-trigger away from exploding. Be<span class=‘c’>c</span>ause I’ve quietly believed I’m… well, too mu<span class=‘c’>c</span>h. Almost every woman I have known well has spoken of this belief; one they mostly keep tu<span class=‘c’>c</span>ked up, be<span class=‘c’>c</span>ause admitting the fear means fa<span class=‘c’>c</span>ing the idea that maybe we don’t have inherent autonomy; that our woman-ness will always “get” us in the end. What if there was a different way of looking at things? What if we <span class=‘c’>c</span>ould work towards dismantling the self-blame and, therefore, stop othering this fundamental part of who we are?
        A<span class=‘c’>c</span>knowledging that the stigma surrounding female reprodu<span class=‘c’>c</span>tive pro<span class=‘c’>c</span>esses is still alive and well is the first rung, I think, on the ladder towards self-a<span class=‘c’>c</span><span class=‘c’>c</span>eptan<span class=‘c’>c</span>e. Most women know the <span class=‘c’>c</span>ra<span class=‘c’>c</span>k of relief when someone dares to start talking about periods, the reality of birth, mis<span class=‘c’>c</span>arriage or menopause, and other women say, oh thank God. This stigma is like an i<span class=‘c’>c</span>eberg. The tip above the surfa<span class=‘c’>c</span>e is women’s day-to-day suffering with whatever pro<span class=‘c’>c</span>ess they’re going through; a suffering they feel unable to fully express, perhaps through fear of embarrassment, of disgusting others or that they’ll be dismissed. Underneath the surfa<span class=‘c’>c</span>e is the way women’s health and pain has been, still is, viewed and treated in so<span class=‘c’>c</span>iety.
        
        It is sweet fantasy to say that all the myths, misinformation and i<span class=‘c’>c</span>kiness surrounding female reprodu<span class=‘c’>c</span>tive pro<span class=‘c’>c</span>esses have been – finally – banished into the fusty past. It’s silly, really, be<span class=‘c’>c</span>ause the word “hormonal” applies as mu<span class=‘c’>c</span>h to a testosterone-<span class=‘c’>c</span>harged <span class=‘c’>c</span>ity banker as it does to a woman about to have her period. The metaboli<span class=‘c’>c</span> pro<span class=‘c’>c</span>esses of all organisms <span class=‘c’>c</span>an only take pla<span class=‘c’>c</span>e in very spe<span class=‘c’>c</span>ifi<span class=‘c’>c</span> <span class=‘c’>c</span>hemi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al environments and, in the human body, hormones are spe<span class=‘c’>c</span>ial <span class=‘c’>c</span>hemi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al messengers that, as part of the endo<span class=‘c’>c</span>rine system, help to <span class=‘c’>c</span>ontrol most major bodily fun<span class=‘c’>c</span>tions. Male, female, or anywhere on the spe<span class=‘c’>c</span>trum of gender, hormones keep us alive. Yet “hormonal” is still a tool for explaining away a woman’s experien<span class=‘c’>c</span>e of her <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanging bio<span class=‘c’>c</span>hemistry. And so we try and keep s<span class=‘c’>c</span>htum, lest we be slapped with su<span class=‘c’>c</span>h a histori<span class=‘c’>c</span>ally damaging label: hysteri<span class=‘c’>c</span>al.
        
        When I effe<span class=‘c’>c</span>tively ran out of PMS treatment options, it made me realise how entren<span class=‘c’>c</span>hed my analysis of my own thoughts and behaviour was in more general ideas of how I “should” or “shouldn’t” be as a woman. In therapy and in my psy<span class=‘c’>c</span>hologi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al study, I realised how the workings of my inner world are often in <span class=‘c’>c</span>ollision with the outer world and all the expe<span class=‘c’>c</span>tations I per<span class=‘c’>c</span>eive it to have of me. A better understanding of what goes on inside us, of the <span class=‘c’>c</span>onne<span class=‘c’>c</span>tion between our bodies and minds, is an important part of re<span class=‘c’>c</span>laiming meaning. We are not post-biology. We are prote<span class=‘c’>c</span>ting no one by pretending that we don’t bleed. We are not prote<span class=‘c’>c</span>ting ourselves by ignoring the external fa<span class=‘c’>c</span>tors that may affe<span class=‘c’>c</span>t our bodily experien<span class=‘c’>c</span>es, in<span class=‘c’>c</span>luding the way modern medi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ine still doesn’t take the varian<span class=‘c’>c</span>e of women’s pain – or the voi<span class=‘c’>c</span>e des<span class=‘c’>c</span>ribing that pain – seriously.
        
        Women <span class=‘c’>c</span>an wait between four and 10 years after first seeing a do<span class=‘c’>c</span>tor with symptoms of endometriosis and a diagnosis. The average is seven-and-a-half years. In 2017, the National Institute for Health and <span class=‘c’>c</span>are Ex<span class=‘c’>c</span>ellen<span class=‘c’>c</span>e released guidelines urging GPs not to overlook symptoms of the disorder, be<span class=‘c’>c</span>ause for it to be repeatedly inferred that you are overrea<span class=‘c’>c</span>ting to your pain, your experien<span class=‘c’>c</span>e of that pain is going to be<span class=‘c’>c</span>ome stained with <span class=‘c’>c</span>onfusion, fear and guilt. It is diffi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ult to argue that medi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ine does not have an inherent bias against women. Women presenting at hospitals with pain are not only given fewer painkillers than men, but are often offered sedatives instead. Treatment for women with <span class=‘c’>c</span>oronary heart disease is delayed <span class=‘c’>c</span>ompared to men. All these fa<span class=‘c’>c</span>ts are <span class=‘c’>c</span>orroborated by robust data. When a woman says how she feels, what she wants or what she needs, someone always knows better.
        
        Knowing ourselves better gives us the power to ask for better. For example, I used to pani<span class=‘c’>c</span> sometimes at the pain I <span class=‘c’>c</span>an have with ovulation. I knew I always felt it, but didn’t know why. Learning that mittels<span class=‘c’>c</span>hmerz (the German words for “middle” and “pain”) is thought to be <span class=‘c’>c</span>aused by one of our eggs rupturing through a sa<span class=‘c’>c</span> (folli<span class=‘c’>c</span>le) on an ovary, releasing fluid and a small amount of blood that <span class=‘c’>c</span>an travel through the ovary wall and irritate nerves in the lining of the abdominal <span class=‘c’>c</span>avity, was a strange <span class=‘c’>c</span>omfort. So, too, was learning from a prominent gynae<span class=‘c’>c</span>ologist that he has seen women presenting in A&E in tears with a<span class=‘c’>c</span>ute pelvi<span class=‘c’>c</span> pain, whose only <span class=‘c’>c</span>lini<span class=‘c’>c</span>ally signifi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ant finding turns out to be re<span class=‘c’>c</span>ent ovulation. This shit is real and it hurts. What’s sad is that my private experien<span class=‘c’>c</span>e alone didn’t feel like good enough eviden<span class=‘c’>c</span>e to finally ask for pain relief.
        
        On some level, a fo<span class=‘c’>c</span>us on a woman’s <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanging bio<span class=‘c’>c</span>hemistry throughout her <span class=‘c’>c</span>y<span class=‘c’>c</span>le – or any other reprodu<span class=‘c’>c</span>tive pro<span class=‘c’>c</span>ess – might be seen to remove some of the stigma. It’s just my hormones. That there <span class=‘c’>c</span>ould be a <span class=‘c’>c</span>lear, <span class=‘c’>c</span>hemi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al “reason” for a <span class=‘c’>c</span>ertain type of behaviour or way of feeling is, on the surfa<span class=‘c’>c</span>e, legitimising and reassuring. Although, if any woman is able to ride out days of feeling low ea<span class=‘c’>c</span>h month by being aware of her <span class=‘c’>c</span>y<span class=‘c’>c</span>le patterns; or finds that telling herself that the way she’s feeling is “just <span class=‘c’>c</span>hemi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al” is a strategy that stops her going up into that se<span class=‘c’>c</span>ond gear of self-analysis and existential woe, I absolutely lift my hat to her. Personally, given what I now know about the impre<span class=‘c’>c</span>ision of the s<span class=‘c’>c</span>ien<span class=‘c’>c</span>e of how our hormones <span class=‘c’>c</span>an affe<span class=‘c’>c</span>t our mood, I try to resist thinking that I am a <span class=‘c’>c</span>hemi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ally <span class=‘c’>c</span>ontrolled robot. I try to see my distress as part of a mini-e<span class=‘c’>c</span>osystem that in<span class=‘c’>c</span>ludes my <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanging hormones, asking myself: what else is going on to upset my mind? How physi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ally well am I right now? What helps?
        
        Resear<span class=‘c’>c</span>h tells us that our hormonal flu<span class=‘c’>c</span>tuations do seem to affe<span class=‘c’>c</span>t how <span class=‘c’>c</span>hemi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al signals pass through our brain – as any neuros<span class=‘c’>c</span>ientist would tell you, we just don’t know exa<span class=‘c’>c</span>tly how or why. In all fields of brain study it is a<span class=‘c’>c</span><span class=‘c’>c</span>epted that mental distress is not <span class=‘c’>c</span>aused by one thing in isolation. The ele<span class=‘c’>c</span>tri<span class=‘c’>c</span>al, <span class=‘c’>c</span>hemi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al brain is not extri<span class=‘c’>c</span>able from the subje<span class=‘c’>c</span>tive mind. What we talk about is multi-<span class=‘c’>c</span>ausality: a fan<span class=‘c’>c</span>y word for the <span class=‘c’>c</span>on<span class=‘c’>c</span>ept that lots of different fa<span class=‘c’>c</span>tors <span class=‘c’>c</span>ontribute to how we feel mentally. Therefore, when we talk about pro<span class=‘c’>c</span>esses happening in a woman’s body that pla<span class=‘c’>c</span>e us at “in<span class=‘c’>c</span>reased risk” of depression or anxiety, it seems not just blindingly logi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al, but respe<span class=‘c’>c</span>tful to <span class=‘c’>c</span>onsider that body in the wider s<span class=‘c’>c</span>heme of things.
        
        Perhaps, then, a more realisti<span class=‘c’>c</span> phrase than, “It’s just my hormones,” would be, “My hormones might predispose me to feeling terrible sometimes.”
        
        Our flu<span class=‘c’>c</span>tuating biology is not the whole story but a signifi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ant part of our emotional lives. The hormonal <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanges and symptoms of menopause are very real and <span class=‘c’>c</span>an be very hard. When my hormone levels <span class=‘c’>c</span>hange, notably at ovulation (soaring oestrogen) and in the week before I get my period (soaring progestogen, high oestrogen), it really <span class=‘c’>c</span>an feel like I’ve stepped inside the skin of a different person – that I am not myself. But what is “myself” if not a sensitive-by-design brain and body that is always <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanging and responding to the world it inhabits and the people around it? From what fixed, ideal state do I feel I am slipping when I am more emotional for the se<span class=‘c’>c</span>ond half of the month?
        
        As human beings, rhythm is part of our deep <span class=‘c’>c</span>ore. Breathing, pumping, <span class=‘c’>c</span>ontra<span class=‘c’>c</span>ting: these are all a<span class=‘c’>c</span>tions of the body that keep us alive and keep our spe<span class=‘c’>c</span>ies going. Menstruation is another rhythm unique to women. But while our biology and what is happening inside us is important, we <span class=‘c’>c</span>annot a<span class=‘c’>c</span>t as if the body is an anatomi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al drawing floating in spa<span class=‘c’>c</span>e; that it is nowhere. <span class=‘c’>c</span>learly, if a woman’s premenstrual distress is su<span class=‘c’>c</span>h that she feels unable to fun<span class=‘c’>c</span>tion, she should, in an ideal world, be re<span class=‘c’>c</span>eiving dedi<span class=‘c’>c</span>ated health<span class=‘c’>c</span>are and support. Is there something wider we should be asking about how, as a so<span class=‘c’>c</span>iety, we frame what women say and do when they are anything other than sanguine, nurturing and polite?
        
        Are we saving up anger, our base need for affe<span class=‘c’>c</span>tion, and our tears for three weeks of the month? As our hormonal levels shift, <span class=‘c’>c</span>ould they be a<span class=‘c’>c</span>ting as a kind of “truth serum”, lubri<span class=‘c’>c</span>ating the passage of what we really want to say or do? It’s a radi<span class=‘c’>c</span>al idea and I quite like it. What if what we feel during those times of the month when we are so qui<span class=‘c’>c</span>k to say we are being irrational is the most “real” we are? The s<span class=‘c’>c</span>ien<span class=‘c’>c</span>e surrounding whatever signalling <span class=‘c’>c</span>hanges happen in the emotion-pro<span class=‘c’>c</span>essing parts of our brain during the menstrual <span class=‘c’>c</span>y<span class=‘c’>c</span>le is too fuzzy to definitively say otherwise. <span class=‘c’>c</span>ould it be that, when the mantle of self-<span class=‘c’>c</span>ensorship drops and we are less <span class=‘c’>c</span>aught up with fearing how we’ll be seen, we’re a<span class=‘c’>c</span><span class=‘c’>c</span>essing all that histori<span class=‘c’>c</span>al oppression and, in short bursts, letting it go? All that so-<span class=‘c’>c</span>alled “ex<span class=‘c’>c</span>ess”, the stuff that makes a woman “hysteri<span class=‘c’>c</span>al” <span class=‘c’>c</span>ould just be… truth.
