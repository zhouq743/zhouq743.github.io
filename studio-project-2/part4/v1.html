    I’m in my mid-30s n<span>o</span>w and my peri<span>o</span>ds <span>h</span>ave always been a p<span>h</span>ysi<span>c</span>al and mental sl<span>o</span>g.

T<span>h</span>ere are m<span>o</span>re t<span>h</span>an 150 <span>c</span>lini<span>c</span>ally identified sympt<span>o</span>ms <span>o</span>f PMS, in<span>c</span>luding irritability, anxiety, depressi<span>o</span>n and <span>h</span>eada<span>c</span><span>h</span>es. A laug<span>h</span> ri<span>o</span>t, in <span>o</span>t<span>h</span>er w<span>o</span>rds.<br>
    
    I <span>h</span>ave spent years trying t<span>o</span> gain aut<span>o</span>n<span>o</span>my <span>o</span>ver t<span>h</span>e way my <span>h</span><span>o</span>rm<span>o</span>nes seem t<span>o</span> make my mind and b<span>o</span>dy be<span>h</span>ave. Ar<span>o</span>und five years ag<span>o</span>, pr<span>o</span>mpted by a breakd<span>o</span>wn-<span>o</span>f-s<span>o</span>rts, I s<span>o</span>ug<span>h</span>t <span>h</span>elp f<span>o</span>r t<span>h</span>e anxiety I <span>h</span>ad d<span>o</span>ne my very best t<span>o</span> <span>c</span><span>o</span>n<span>c</span>eal fr<span>o</span>m every<span>o</span>ne, in<span>c</span>luding myself, f<span>o</span>r well <span>o</span>ver a de<span>c</span>ade. After talking t<span>o</span> my GP, I tried all s<span>o</span>rts <span>o</span>f interventi<span>o</span>ns in my quest f<span>o</span>r em<span>o</span>ti<span>o</span>nal stability. I was referred t<span>o</span> (alm<span>o</span>st ex<span>c</span>lusively male) gynae<span>c</span><span>o</span>l<span>o</span>gists w<span>h</span><span>o</span>se <span>c</span><span>o</span>nversati<span>o</span>ns and <span>h</span><span>o</span>rm<span>o</span>nal pres<span>c</span>ripti<span>o</span>ns made me feel eit<span>h</span>er a) madder <span>o</span>r b) ever s<span>o</span> slig<span>h</span>tly less mad f<span>o</span>r a s<span>h</span><span>o</span>rt am<span>o</span>unt <span>o</span>f time. I tried a<span>c</span>upun<span>c</span>ture, vitamin supplements and diet <span>c</span><span>h</span>anges. I realised t<span>h</span>is pre<span>c</span>ise, reliable em<span>o</span>ti<span>o</span>nal state I s<span>o</span>ug<span>h</span>t was elusive at best.<br>
    
    Instead, I was surprised by a gr<span>o</span>wing sense <span>o</span>f pea<span>c</span>e. Addressing t<span>h</span>e patterns <span>o</span>f my m<span>o</span><span>o</span>d wit<span>h</span> a t<span>h</span>erapist, we l<span>o</span><span>o</span>ked <span>c</span>l<span>o</span>sely at t<span>h</span>e s<span>h</span>ame I atta<span>c</span><span>h</span>ed t<span>o</span> being sensitive, sad <span>o</span>r s<span>c</span>ared in t<span>h</span>e se<span>c</span><span>o</span>nd <span>h</span>alf <span>o</span>f my <span>c</span>y<span>c</span>le and asked w<span>h</span>ere it <span>c</span>ame fr<span>o</span>m. After resear<span>c</span><span>h</span>ing anxiety, I started training t<span>o</span> be<span>c</span><span>o</span>me a psy<span>c</span><span>h</span><span>o</span>l<span>o</span>gist and began resear<span>c</span><span>h</span>ing <span>h</span><span>o</span>rm<span>o</span>nes. I started t<span>o</span> see t<span>h</span>ings in a way I never t<span>h</span><span>o</span>ug<span>h</span>t I w<span>o</span>uld. I <span>h</span>ad a new questi<span>o</span>n, and t<span>h</span>at was: w<span>h</span>at am I seeking relief fr<span>o</span>m?<br>
    
    I’ve <span>c</span><span>o</span>me t<span>o</span> believe t<span>h</span>at greater awareness <span>o</span>f <span>o</span>ur <span>h</span><span>o</span>rm<span>o</span>nal pr<span>o</span><span>c</span>esses <span>c</span>an <span>h</span>elp us n<span>o</span>t <span>o</span>nly t<span>o</span> manage <span>o</span>ur <span>c</span><span>o</span>rresp<span>o</span>nding m<span>o</span><span>o</span>ds, but als<span>o</span> t<span>o</span> <span>c</span><span>o</span>n<span>c</span>eptualise w<span>h</span>at a m<span>o</span><span>o</span>d a<span>c</span>tually is: a state <span>o</span>f being t<span>h</span>at is, by its nature, temp<span>o</span>rary, and rarely dire<span>c</span>tly attributable t<span>o</span> <span>o</span>ne t<span>h</span>ing. It’s an interesting di<span>c</span><span>h</span><span>o</span>t<span>o</span>my, t<span>h</span>at we <span>c</span>an be quite dis<span>c</span><span>o</span>nne<span>c</span>ted fr<span>o</span>m w<span>h</span>at’s a<span>c</span>tually g<span>o</span>ing <span>o</span>n w<span>h</span>en <span>o</span>ur <span>h</span><span>o</span>rm<span>o</span>nes are flu<span>c</span>tuating – w<span>h</span>en <span>o</span>estr<span>o</span>gen dramati<span>c</span>ally rises, f<span>o</span>r example, during <span>o</span>vulati<span>o</span>n – and yet be s<span>o</span> ready t<span>o</span> self-p<span>o</span>li<span>c</span>e w<span>h</span>en we feel anyt<span>h</span>ing <span>o</span>t<span>h</span>er t<span>h</span>an sanguine and pain-free.<br>

T<span>h</span>at wasn’t t<span>h</span>e real me, we mig<span>h</span>t t<span>h</span>ink, ag<span>o</span>nising <span>o</span>ver a knee-jerk de<span>c</span>isi<span>o</span>n we made at w<span>o</span>rk, <span>o</span>r taking <span>o</span>ffen<span>c</span>e at a t<span>h</span>r<span>o</span>waway <span>c</span><span>o</span>mment in t<span>h</span>e pub.
