    <h1>What's inside a Computer Case</h1>
    <p>A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, tower, system unit, or cabinet, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a personal computer (usually excluding the display, keyboard, and mouse).</p>
    <p>Cases are usually constructed from steel (often SECCâ€”steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil), aluminium and plastic. Other materials such as glass, wood, acrylic and even Lego bricks have appeared in home-built cases.</p>
